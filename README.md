# Quality assessment tool created for Digiroad bus stop data validation and evaluation
This tool was created as a part of a Master's thesis (Pro gradu)  [Automating and visualising the assessment of the geospatial data quality â€“ case Digiroad](https://www.utupub.fi/handle/10024/178626).

The tool consists of a Python Jupyter Notebook file that validates the attribute completeness, spatial completeness, temporal accuracy, and positional accuracy of public transportation data in Finland and visualizes it with graphs and as a interactive Leaflet map.

An example of the map that was created in the thesis can be found online here: [Digiroad Stops QI Map](https://jennikarro.github.io/DRStops-QI-map.html)

The code was created using local data files, so in order to utilize the tool as it is you will need to either download your own data files. In the thesis work OSM data was downloaded via QGIS plugin [QuickOSM](https://github.com/3liz/QuickOSM) and Finnish bus stop data can be acquired from [The Finnish Transport Agency](https://suomenvaylat.vayla.fi/?lang=en) You are of course welcome the edit the code as you wish and import the data in some other way, or even utilize the tool for your own works. 

As a final disclaimer: The tool will not be updated in the future as of now, so syntax, functions etc. may expire.
